# CS103a Express App Demo

This is the Creative Web App 2 that I made to make birthday card text.

## Installation
Download the project from github and download nodejs and npm from https://nodejs.org
and cd into the folder

Install the packages with
``` bash
npm install
```
Start the project with
``` bash
node app.js
```
or install nodemon (the node monitoring app) with
``` bash
npm install -g nodemon
```
and start the project with
``` bash
nodemon
```
Once you do the above, you can put in a web browser: "localhost:5000" and the
web app will run! Then you can put in your birthday app!
